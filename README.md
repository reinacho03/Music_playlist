# My Music Player Project

## Proposal
I am planning to make a music player that completes different tasks for a user. 
People who want to listen to any kinds of songs are going to use this application. 
This project is of interest to me as I enjoy listen to music in my free time and even when I am studying. 
Thus, it would be a fun project for me if I can create my own music player and 
understand how it works. 

## Tasks of a music player:
- *plays* songs for the users
- *saves* the playlist that the users have created
- *finds* a song when the user searches for it in the search bar

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* a song to my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* multiple songs to my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to *remove* a song from my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to *search* a song from my playlist.
- As a user, when I quit the music player, I want to be given the option to *save* the playlist that I have created. 
- As a user, when I start the music player, I want to be given the option to *load* the playlist that I have created.
