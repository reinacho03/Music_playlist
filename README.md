# My Music Player Project

## Proposal
I am planning to make a music player that completes different tasks for a user. 
People who want to listen to any kinds of songs are going to use this application. 
This project is of interest to me as I enjoy listen to music in my free time and even when I am studying. 
Thus, it would be a fun project for me if I can create my own music player and 
understand how it works. 

## Tasks of a music player:
- *plays* songs for the users
- *saves* the playlist that the users have created
- *finds* a song when the user searches for it in the search bar

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* a song to my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* multiple songs to my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to *remove* a song from my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to *search* a song from my playlist.
- As a user, when I quit the music player, I want to be given the option to *save* the playlist that I have created. 
- As a user, when I start the music player, I want to be given the option to *load* the playlist that I have created.


## Instructions for Graders
- You can generate the first requires action related to adding a song to a playlist by selecting one of the song buttons 
and selecting "0" button on the same row. Then, the song item would appear in the text area. 
- You can generate the second requires action related to adding multiple songs to a playlist by selecting one 
song at each time. For example, you can select the first item and press "O" next to it, which will add the item to the 
playlist. Then, you can select the third item and press "O" on the same row, which will add this selected item to the
list. In total, there are two songs in the playlist. 
- You can locate my visual component by images added to each button that represents each song item. 
- You can reload the state of my application by selecting "load" menu after setting your username and 
pressing "OK" button, which redirects you to the selection page and text area that displays the playlist.
